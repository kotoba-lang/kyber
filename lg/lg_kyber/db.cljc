(ns lg.lg-kyber.db
  "kyber data layer — the `:db-api` injection seam (port of lg_kyber/db.py).

  db.py is an asyncpg pool against RisingWave PG :4566. asyncpg has no babashka/JVM
  equivalent, so rather than port the *connection*, this ns ports the *contract* the
  graph nodes actually depend on — three fns `fetch` / `fetchval` / `execute` — as an
  injectable map (the actor-pattern Store swap: `MemStore ‖ DatomicStore`). A node reads
  its db-api out of the graph state (key `:lg.lg-kyber.db/db-api`) and calls it; tests
  inject `match-db` (canned, deterministic), production injects a real PG-backed map.

  Contract (a plain map, so it is host-independent and contract-testable):
    {:fetchval (fn [query & args] -> scalar)
     :fetch    (fn [query & args] -> [row-map …])
     :execute  (fn [query & args] -> status-string)}

  This mirrors the repo's `:db-api` convention (CLAUDE.md §Actors: backends speak through
  a `{:q :transact! :db :pull :entid}`-style map; here it is the narrower fetch/exec trio
  the kyber graphs use)."

  records calls into the supplied atom (or no-ops) and returns \"INSERT 0 1\".
